# turtle_on_fire

Turtle in flutter and dart

**_Cross platform and super cool_**

__This is still WIP, so no guarantee this will work for you too!__

Idea is to use the Lindenmayer System to calculate sentences and from there patterns.  
In the working prototype are those rules applied.

ToDo:

- get some sort of input working
- introduce concepts of time (speed), colors, loops and functions working for the user
- clean the UI ;)
